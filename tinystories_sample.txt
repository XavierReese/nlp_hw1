they hugged each other and went off to study something else.
she ran to her mom and said, "look, mom, i made a car.
the bear looked around and said â€œitâ€™s alright now!
it was going to a distant place, far away from the sea.
but his friend, a small fish named tim, swam up to him and said, "bob, don't touch that!
the little girl knew it was a bad sign and wanted to run away but somehow the woman kept her in place, dancing around her.
you could fall in and get hurt." sara and tom hug their mom and say sorry.
he says he will come back soon.
he pushes some buttons and pulls some levers on the rocket.
they know what is best for you.
"this has been a perfect day, don't you think?", lucy asked with a bright smile.
it is very interesting.
he thought, "i will borrow a big umbrella from my friend, so spot and i can play outside, even when it's gloomy." the hunter went to his friend's house and asked if he could borrow the umbrella.
tim wanted to cut the picture.
"can i take the quiz, mommy?" his mom smiled and nodded.
once upon a time, there was a little girl named lily.
and maybe it will not laugh at us.
when the cake was done, tim and his mom tasted it.
it looks like a big pink bird.
lily always remembered to be honest and gentle with her friend, the duck.
suddenly, a little bird flew down and perched on her shoulder.
she said to the shy flower, "i will use this whip to help you grow.
they learn that sharing and caring are more important than winning.
it was brown and yucky.
she wanted to see it up close, but she was scared to climb up there.
you didn't cry.
the brother picked up an acorn.
the king thanked the children for their game.
she said, "look at this page.
lily and true are best friends.
timmy felt sad because he didn't mean to break the egg.
now you wonâ€™t be so hungry.â€ the little bunny smiled in agreement and hopped away, content and full.
he didn't understand that it wasn't right to keep something that didn't belong to him.
they wanted to make the little girl feel better.
he said to himself "i'm going to jump in the puddle!" he ran to his cart and grabbed it.
she said, "i want the apple, mom." tom looked around.
the dog likes to play, too.
let's do something fun together and maybe that will help you feel better".
she told dad that the books were for school.
he saw the fearful helicopter and wanted to help.
suddenly, bambi heard a voice.
tom found the sauce.
they like to play in the park.
he was just a little bird and the other animals were much bigger and faster.
he stopped for a closer look and realised that this spark was a fairy!
from that day on, lily always made sure to ask what was in someone's sandwich before eating it.
he listened carefully while the dragon read him the book.
"we made the sunshine come back!" tom said.
the daddy bear said to his cub, "let's keep looking for honey!" the cub asked, "do we always keep looking for honey?" daddy bear smiled and said, "yes, my cub.

he couldn't find his phone.
she looked around and noticed the dogs sleeping in the garden.
one day, joe decided to ask the farmer for help.

how could you be so naughty and careless?" she took ben and mia by the hand and dragged them to their room.
she said, "ben, you are a lazy bee.
lily liked to play with her toy vehicles.
she smiled when she saw the cricket and said, "hello!" the cricket was a little frightened, but also happy to meet the girl.
once upon a time, there was a boy named timmy.
and from that day on, the big tree was their favorite place to dance and play.
please change your clothes." but sara does not listen.
at last, they find the treasure.
you should share your marble with me." tom says, "no, i won't share my marble with you.
he ran up to the puppy and gave it a big hug.
the puppy was so cheerful and happy that the boy made a promise to care for him forever.
the gate is not locked and tom opens it.
mom smiles.
the dog is brown and fluffy.
she ran out of the shop with the paper.
a repairman came to help.

the bear was very sad.
he said to mia, "look, my pants are bad.
the little girl was so excited that she ran the rest of the way.
the farmer saw the miserable pig and was eager to help.
they were happy.
let's go see!" so, tim and sue went to the library to find the book.
i'm glad we shared it together." then he said goodbye and ran off.
lily went back inside to play with her doll.
jessie was sad that she had embarrassed her mother, and the delicate beauty of nature had, for a moment, been forgotten.
as lily cooked, her family could smell the spicy food.
one day, they found a big mushroom under a tree.
mama was nervous, but gretel felt brave.
billy asked, "can we play soccer with your yellow ball?" timmy replied, "yes, we can play soccer, but we need to be careful with my ball." they played soccer for a while, but then it started to rain.
they said, "no, we want to jump on the sofa and the cushions!
suddenly, max got a silly idea.
we wanted to give it to you," tom said, handing him the envelope.
they get confused and bored.
i can help you make a sandwich, if you want.
lily didn't understand what was happening, so she just shrugged her shoulders and went to play by herself.
the other monkeys cheered.
and i love anna." she took anna and went to clean her room.
tim and kim are happy and grateful.
that is mean." she takes the switch from ben.
"would you like to go on an adventure with me?" alice was a little scared but she was also very excited.
you're safe now," their mom said, wrapping them in a towel and squeezing them tight.
they said, "good dog, good dog!
she wished she could play with the computer again.
"ben, lily, why did you fight over the doll?
they say, "don't worry, pets.
